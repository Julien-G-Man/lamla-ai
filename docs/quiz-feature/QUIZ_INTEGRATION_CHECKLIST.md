## Testing Flow

### Test 1: Happy Path (Text-based)
1. Go to CreateQuiz
2. Select "Mathematics"
3. Enter study text (~500 chars)
4. Set MCQ=5, Short=2
5. Click "Generate Quiz"
6. **Expected:** Quiz page loads with all questions

### Test 2: Happy Path (File-based)

### Test 4: Results Verification
1. Check score calculation: correct_count / total
2. Check percentage calculation: (score / total) * 100
3. Review each question with explanation
4. **Expected:** All calculations correct

### Test 5: Error Handling
1. Try empty text → Error shown
2. Try no file upload → Error shown
3. Try invalid file → Error shown
4. **Expected:** All errors handled gracefully

## Log Verification

### Django Console Should Show:
```
✅ POST /api/quiz/ajax-extract-text/ → 200 OK

Response body has: {score, total, score_percent, details}
```

### Console
```
