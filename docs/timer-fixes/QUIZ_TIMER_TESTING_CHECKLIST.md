## 📋 Known Limitations

- Console logs appear every 60 seconds (by design for performance)
- Last minute shows detailed logs (every second)
- Auto-submit shows alert (unavoidable for user experience)
- Timer resets to full time on page refresh (expected behavior)

## 📞 Escalation

If tests fail:

1. **Check DevTools Console** for error messages
2. **Clear localStorage** and retry
3. **Review [QUIZ_TIMER_FIX.md](QUIZ_TIMER_FIX.md)** for debugging help
4. **Check Network tab** for API responses
