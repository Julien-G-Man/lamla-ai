"""
One-time backfill command.

Reads all existing QuizSession rows and builds TopicPerformance +
QuizTopicSchedule from them so historical data is reflected in weak
area detection and spaced scheduling.

Safe to re-run: existing rows are updated with the full aggregate, so
running this twice does not double-count anything.

Usage:
    python manage.py backfill_topic_performance
    python manage.py backfill_topic_performance --dry-run
